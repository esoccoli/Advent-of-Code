# 2022 Puzzles

My first time ever doing Advent of Code. I managed to solve up to day 15 (with progressively increasing difficulty) before giving up because I don't understand the puzzles. I may eventually go back and try to solve the rest of them.

## Solved in C#

I am currently trying to work through the puzzles that I have already done, trying to redo them/make the code look nice. I will upload my code for each day once I make it look readable. Cannot guarantee that they will be working, because I get frustrated quickly if it doesn't work and I can't figure out why. If a solution doesn't work properly, I will make a note of it in the commit message. I will try to make them work eventually, but no guarantees.
